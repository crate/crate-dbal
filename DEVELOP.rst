*************
Using Vagrant
*************


Prerequisites
=============

You will need Vagrant_ and one of its providers.

We currently use VirtualBox_ but any provider should work just as well.

Installation
============

Clone the project::

    git clone git@github.com:crate/crate-dbal.git
    cd crate-dbal

Start up the Vagrant machine::

    vagrant up

When run for the first time, it will also run the needed provisioning.

If you are using IntelliJ or PhpStorm IDE you can follow the `IDE guide`_ to
set up your remote interpreter and test environment.

Running the Tests
=================

You can run the tests like::

    vagrant ssh
    cd /vagrant

    # Run test suite
    composer run test

    # Run code style checks
    composer run check-style

    # Some code style quirks can be automatically fixed
    composer run fix-style



************
Using Docker
************


Installation
============

Install prerequisites::

    # Install different PHP releases.
    brew install php@7.3 php@7.4 php@8.0 brew-php-switcher composer

    # Select PHP version.
    brew-php-switcher 7.3
    brew-php-switcher 7.4
    brew-php-switcher 8.0

    # Install xdebug extension for tracking code coverage.
    pecl install xdebug

Get the sources::

    git clone git@github.com:crate/crate-dbal.git
    cd crate-dbal

Setup project dependencies::

    composer install


Running the Tests
=================

::

    # Run CrateDB
    docker run -it --rm --publish 4200:4200 --publish 5432:5432 crate/crate:nightly

    # Run test suite
    composer run test

    # Run code style checks
    composer run style

    # Run code style checks
    ./vendor/bin/phpcs ./src


****************************
Working on the documentation
****************************

- The documentation is written using `Sphinx`_ and `ReStructuredText`_.
- Python>=3.7 is required.

Change into the ``docs`` directory:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd docs

For help, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make

    Crate Docs Build

    Run `make <TARGET>`, where <TARGET> is one of:

      dev     Run a Sphinx development server that builds and lints the
              documentation as you edit the source files

      html    Build the static HTML output

      check   Build, test, and lint the documentation

      qa      Generate QA telemetry

      reset   Reset the build

You must install `fswatch`_ to use the ``dev`` target.


Continuous integration and deployment
=====================================

CI is configured to run ``make check`` from the ``docs`` directory.

`Read the Docs`_ (RTD) automatically deploys the documentation whenever a
configured branch is updated.

To make changes to the RTD configuration (e.g., to activate or deactivate a
release version), please contact the `@crate/tech-writing`_ team.


Archiving Docs Versions
=======================

Check the `versions hosted on ReadTheDocs`_.

We should only be hosting the docs for `latest`, the last three minor release
branches of the last major release, and the last minor release branch
corresponding to the last two major releases.

For example:

- ``latest``
- ``0.3``
- ``0.2``
- ``0.1``

Because this project has not yet had a major release, as of yet, there are no
major releases before `0` to include in this list.

To make changes to the RTD configuration (e.g., to activate or deactivate a
release version), please contact the `@crate/docs`_ team.
